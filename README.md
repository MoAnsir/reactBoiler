# React boiler plate
 
This is my reactjs starting template. It will start you off with react, babel, webpack and the dev-server.
 
## Getting Started 
 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. 
 
### Prerequisites 
 
you will need to have node and npm installed on your machine. check if you have them with the following 
 
``` 
node -v 
npm -v 
``` 
 
if you don't see a version number then you have to install node on your machine  
 
``` 
https://nodejs.org/en/ 
``` 
 
### Installing 
 
there is a package.json file that defines all the packages need for this project. 
All you need to do is install via npm in the project directory  
 
 
``` 
npm install 
``` 
This will install all the stuff you need to run the project  
 
To run the project locally use the following commands in the project directory 
 
This will build the site 
``` 
webpack 
``` 
 
This will watch for changes and rebuild the site 
``` 
webpack --watch 
``` 
 
This will minify all our file and get it ready for production 
```
